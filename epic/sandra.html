<h3>Attitudes and Behaviors</h3>
<p>For as long as Sandra can remember she has always been interested in art. She started drawing early on but fell in love with painting after going to a summer camp at the age of 10. After that, she used her birthday and holiday money to buy art supplies and spent her free time experimenting with colors and styles. As she got older, her time became a balancing act between her classes, sports and painting. After high school, she attended CNM full-time for a semester but after arguments with her parents about her taking art classes she moved out of her parents house. She is currently pursuing a Fine Arts / Studio Concentration degree at CNM but her financial situation didn't allow her to take more than one class at a time. She has worked on various group murals and two murals of her own. After the covid 19 shut down she was laid off and is collecting unemployment. Not having to work has given her the ability to devote a lot more time to painting.</p>
<h3>Frustrations and Needs</h3>
<p>Sandra's family has never taken her love of art as a serious interest. It was more of a way to pass the time when she wasn't doing something important. Her mother wanted her to go to college and get real job while her father expected her to find a husband, have kids, and be a proper housewife. She visits her family periodically but her relationship with her parents is strained because they don't understand why she is "wasting her time". Sandra is determined to make a career in art and prove herself. She is looking into numerous ways to get exposure.</p>
<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>Sandra sees painting murals as a way to get others familiar with her art. She hopes that interest in her as an artist will increase and her dream is to sell her paintings in an art gallery.</p>
