How to do this:
Go through your wireframes and think about how you are using each of your entities on each page.
* Are you filtering your entities by something?
* Are you getting all of them?
* Are you displaying them one at a time?  By what criteria? (id, name, email etc.)
When you're finished, make sure you get an instructor feedback on your choices.
